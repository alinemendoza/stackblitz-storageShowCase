# Lesson Plan: Web Storage Methods

## Overview

This lesson plan is designed for 9th-grade computer science students to understand three common web storage methods: JSON files, Sessions, and LocalStorage. The Storage Explorer application serves as an interactive demonstration tool for these concepts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the differences between server-side and client-side storage
2. Describe how JSON files, Sessions, and LocalStorage work
3. Identify appropriate use cases for each storage method
4. Interact with a web application that demonstrates these storage techniques
5. Analyze code that implements these storage methods

## Materials Needed

- Computer lab with internet access
- The Storage Explorer application
- Optional: Printed copies of the documentation

## Estimated Time

- 2-3 class periods (45-50 minutes each)

## Lesson Structure

### Day 1: Introduction to Web Storage

#### 1. Introduction (10 minutes)
- Introduction to the concept of data persistence
- The challenge of the web's stateless nature
- Why different storage methods are needed

#### 2. Overview of Storage Methods (15 minutes)
- Brief introduction to each storage method:
  - JSON Files: Server-side, persistent, shared
  - Sessions: Server-side, temporary, user-specific
  - LocalStorage: Client-side, persistent, user-specific

#### 3. Storage Explorer Demo (20 minutes)
- Guided tour of the Storage Explorer application
- Demonstration of each tab's functionality
- How to interact with the application

#### 4. Wrap-up and Questions (5 minutes)
- Preview of next day's activities
- Initial questions from students

### Day 2: Deep Dive into Storage Methods

#### 1. JSON File Storage (15 minutes)
- What is JSON?
- How the server reads and writes JSON files
- Code walkthrough of the server-side implementation
- Advantages and limitations

#### 2. Sessions (15 minutes)
- How sessions work with cookies
- Session creation, retrieval, and expiration
- Code walkthrough of session implementation
- Security considerations

#### 3. LocalStorage (15 minutes)
- Browser storage capabilities
- LocalStorage API
- Code walkthrough of client-side implementation
- Persistence between visits

#### 4. Guided Practice (5 minutes)
- Start on basic exercises from the exercises document

### Day 3: Hands-on Practice

#### 1. Review (10 minutes)
- Quick recap of the three storage methods
- Addressing common questions from previous day

#### 2. Individual Exercises (25 minutes)
- Students work through exercises from the exercises document
- Teacher circulates to help and assess understanding

#### 3. Group Discussion (10 minutes)
- Compare and contrast the three storage methods
- Discuss real-world examples
- Address the discussion questions from the exercises document

#### 4. Assessment and Wrap-up (5 minutes)
- Quick quiz on key concepts
- Preview of how these concepts connect to future lessons

## Assessment

### Formative Assessment
- Observation during guided practice
- Responses during group discussions
- Completion of basic exercises

### Summative Assessment
- Completion of advanced exercises
- Short quiz on storage methods concepts
- Optional: Small project implementation using at least two storage methods

## Extensions and Modifications

### For Advanced Students
- Challenge them to complete the "Create Your Own Storage Demo" project
- Ask them to research and present on additional storage methods (IndexedDB, WebSQL)

### For Students Needing Support
- Provide printed reference guides
- Partner with more advanced peers
- Focus on the basic exercises only
