# Comparing Storage Methods

## Storage Methods at a Glance

| Feature | JSON Files | Sessions | LocalStorage |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Where data is stored** | Server | Server | Browser |
| **Persistence** | Until deleted | Temporary (expires) | Until cleared |
| **Access** | All users | Only the user who created it | Only in the user's browser |
| **Size limits** | System storage | Server memory | 5-10MB per domain |
| **Security** | Depends on server | Good (server-side) | Limited (client-side) |
| **Speed** | Slower (file I/O) | Fast | Very fast |
| **Complexity** | Medium | Medium | Simple |

## Choosing the Right Storage Method

### Use JSON Files When:
- Data needs to be shared between users
- You need a simple database-like storage
- You want easy human-readable data files
- Data needs to persist server-side

**Example in our app:** Game characters that all users can see

### Use Sessions When:
- You need to store user-specific data securely
- Data should expire after inactivity
- You need server-side validation
- You're tracking login state or other temporary user info

**Example in our app:** User's game profile during their visit

### Use LocalStorage When:
- You want data to persist between visits
- You're storing user preferences
- You need client-side only storage
- You want to reduce server load
- You're caching data to improve performance

**Example in our app:** Game settings and preferences

## Storage Methods in the Real World

### Real Examples of JSON Files:
- Configuration files for applications
- Data exports/imports
- API responses
- Small data collections for simple applications

### Real Examples of Sessions:
- User login state
- Shopping carts
- Multi-step form data
- Temporary preferences

### Real Examples of LocalStorage:
- Theme preferences (dark/light mode)
- Form data autosave
- Application state between visits
- Recently viewed items
- User preferences
- Game progress

## Storage Methods Working Together

In many applications, these storage methods work together:

1. **JSON Files** store the core data everyone needs (products, articles, etc.)
2. **Sessions** track user-specific temporary data (login state, current activities)
3. **LocalStorage** remembers user preferences and improves performance

Our Storage Explorer demo shows how these three methods can be used together in a single application to handle different types of data with different requirements.
